# blackjack
I started learning C# and the best way to learn is to make a project, so I decided to make CLI Blackjack.

# instructions
Download and run `dotnet run`. You can enter abbreviated commands for all of the player actions (the first letter of the word apart from 'surrender', which uses 'u').

# ruleset
I tried to include everything from a standard game of Blackjack & the only thing missing is split. Why? Because it would have been lots of work & I didn't feel like implementing it.

If someone finds this project & begs me to add it, I will. If not, this is just a fun little way to learn C# so my game of Blackjack doesn't have split.
